Palette
===

Palette is a simple drawing tool to make silly marker drawings or diagrams.

I was initially going to create a Paint-like web application, but I quickly realized I was overcomplicating things by adding in selection tools, rectangles, etc.

The [live version](http://palette.jgefroh.com) can be found on my website.
